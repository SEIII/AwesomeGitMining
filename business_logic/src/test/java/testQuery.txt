����The Way to Success

������Give me six hours to chop down a tree , and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.��Abraham Lincoln once said. Although four hours seem to be quite a long time, it can help people chop down the tree more smoothly and less laboriously in the rest two hours. It is obvious that a full preparation can enhance the efficiency of trees-chopping.

����The saying aims at informing us of the significance of adequate preparation. Definitely , we can��t emphasize the importance of full preparation too much in our pursuit of success. A full preparation enables us to achieve our objectives and realize our dreams more smoothly and rapidly. The more preparation we make, the more likely we are to become confidence, reduce the risks of failure and seize the fleeting opportunities. For example, when graduates hunt for jobs, it is those who are well prepared that can surpass other candidates and get the offer finally.

����Accordingly, at no time should we overlook the power of preparation. Besides, we need to set up a proper goal, carry out a full investigation and elaborate a detailed plan before we take actions. ��Preparation breeds success.�� Benjamin Franklin also once said.
1.细数门前落叶，倾听窗外雨声，涉水而过的声音此次响起，你被雨淋湿的心，是否依旧。
 
2.站在寒冬的冷风中，漫天的雪花正纷纷扬扬地包裹着这座寒冷的城市。想着逝去了的那份真挚的无价情义，我忍不住怆然泪下。
 
3.你在雨中行走，你从不打伞；你有自己的天空，它从不下雨。
 
4.那段岁月，无论从何种角度读你，你都完美无缺，你所缺少的部分，也早已被我用想象的画笔填满。
 
5.回首往事，日子中竟全是斑斓的光影，记忆的屏障中，曾经心动的声音已渐渐远去。
 
6.往事是尘封在记忆中的梦，而你是我唯一鲜明的记忆，那绿叶上的水珠，是思念的泪滴。
 
7.相信优美的生命，就是一曲无字的挽歌，漫过心际的孤独，早已蔚然成冰，而你，是这个季节最美丽的音符。
 
8.酒般的思念，一饮就醉，醉时就用全部的热情读这忧伤的月色。于是，月醉了，夜醉了，我也醉了。
 
9.谁与我醉明月，愁在夕阳中。
 
10.融进银河，就安谧地和明月为伴，照亮长天；没入草莽，就微笑着同清风合力，染绿大地。这样，才算得上善待生命，不负年华。
 
11.她忧伤而美丽的面容，是我一辈子都读不厌倦的诗。
 
12.爱是一种牵挂，无论步迹到哪里，心却系在那披肩秀发的发梢。
